# Purpose

This project is for study purposes, the intention is to perform recognition in various audios and predict 
which class the audio belongs to. The intention also includes recreate some known methods like (fft, stft, fbank, mfcc, etc.) 
to better understand them and to provide this content to more people. In the future this project will be used to 
recognize other types of audiences in a personal project (which will also be open).
